## Database Management: Normalization Exercise Suite

You have been hired to assist the company in analyzing its business activities and to design a set of relational tables that they can use to develop a database system.

The company will provide you with copies of all their paper based forms (invoices, orders, batch records, etc). You will use these over several weeks to analyze the various forms and produce **third normal form (3NF)** relational **entity relationship diagrams (ERD)** for each **view** of their data. As a last step in the process, you will **merge** all the views to produce **one integrated ERD** and **fully detailed relational entities.**
