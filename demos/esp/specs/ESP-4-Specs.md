## Payments to Suppliers for Purchase Orders

ESP pays the full amount of each purchase order when it is due. ESP may pay for more than one purchase order with one cheque if they are all from the same supplier. The cheque is always written for the full and correct amount of all the purchase orders being paid for. ESP keeps a register of its cheques that looks as follows:

Each cheque number is unique and numbers are never used over again.

You are to take the information about the Cheque Register, provided above, and prepare a set of **3NF** relational entities and produce a relational **3NF ERD.**
