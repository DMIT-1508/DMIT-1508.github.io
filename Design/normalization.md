## Zero Normal Form

While Zero-Normal Form (**0NF**) isn't regarded by most as an official step, it's nonetheless crucial. The whole goal of this phase is to *identify all the attributes* of your entity. In the process of doing this, it's vital that you make sure

- your attributes are in their *atomic* form (the smallest, most meaningful information),
- you have clearly identified the *repeating groups* somehow (such as putting them inside curly braces),
- you have identified what attribute is acting to *uniquely identify* the entity as a whole (usually it's a single attribute), and
- you have given a name to your entity


## First Normal Form

First Normal Form (**1NF**) is all about *separating out **repeating groups*** of information.

## Second Normal Form

Second Normal Form (**2NF**) is all about *separating out **partial dependencies***.

## Third Normal Form

Third Normal Form (**3NF**) is all about *separating out **transitive dependencies***.
